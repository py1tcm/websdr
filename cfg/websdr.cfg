# first, a few generalities about the server:

# The maximum number of users.
# In most cases, the internet uplink is the limiting factor; count on about
# 100 kbit/s per user, depending on the compression level you choose.
maxusers 20

# Set a timeout of x seconds for idle users (i.e., users who don't
# change the frequency etc. for x seconds are disconnected).
# Can be useful if your site is popular and has limited internet
# bandwidth.
idletimeout 7200

# On which port should the server listen?
# An obvious choice would be 80, so users don't need to specify it in the URL.
# However, this requires the websdr binary to be setuid root, see install.txt.
# A common alternative choice is 8901.
tcpport 8901

# If (and only if) you are running the WebSDR on a computer that is shared
# with users that you do not trust, uncomment the following line.
# It disables the system administration interface in sysop.html.
#donttrustlocalhost

# If your computer is on a 10.x.x.x or 192.168.x.x network on which there
# are no users that you do not trust, uncomment the following line.
# It enables the system administration interface in sysop.html also for computers
# on these local networks.

# If you do NOT want your WebSDR to register itself on http://www.websdr.org
# site, uncomment the following line:
noorgserver

# The following lines contain information that is transmitted to websdr.org:

# What is your system's (public) hostname?
# (Note: give _only_ the hostname here, _not_ the complete URL; so leave out
# the 'http://' and the portnumber.)
# If left commented out, the www.websdr.org page will show the IP address.
#hostname websdr.sytes.net
hostname websdr.dynv6.net

# Your system's locator square:
org qth GG77xm

# A short description of your site:
org description WebSDR Rio de Janeiro - Volta Redonda

# If you want your logo to appear on the http://www.websdr.org site, do the following:
# - make a 48x48 (non-animated, please!) picture in a usual format, such as GIF, PNG or JPEG;
# - put it in the pub directory of your websdr server;
# - uncomment the following line and put your picture's filename in it:
org logo HamHomer.png

# please provide your e-mail address; this will NOT appear on http://websdr.org
# but will be used for sending you software updates in the future.

# We need to configure at least one band:

# First give it a short name, e.g. "20m":
band SoftRock 80M

# From what sound device should the I/Q audio signals be read;
# typically either /dev/dsp or /dev/dsp0 is your system's primary sound card.
# If your system does not have OSS but does have ALSA, enter the ALSA device
# name here, preceeded by a dollar sign.
#
# OSS example:
#device /dev/dsp
# ALSA example:
device $hw:1,0,0
#device $hw:0,0,0

# Samplerate in Hz:
samplerate 192000
#samplerate 96000

# Center frequency in kHz:
centerfreq 3716 
#initial 7058 lsb
# A short description of the antenna, for listing on websdr.org:
##antenna Vertical 20/15/10m
swapiq
# If needed, you can amplify or attenuate the signals by a number of dB:
#gain 20
gain -38
# If you have a calibrated signal source, you can use this to calibrate the
# S-meter in dBm.
